# PokeBuddy
We want to make some sort of paint app that uses the graphic functions from the TFT_eSPI library in hope that we make some animatios for our project in a more compact format.
##**To do list:**\n
*Extract the main functions we're gonna use from the header file *check*
*Find a way to take the function result and display it
