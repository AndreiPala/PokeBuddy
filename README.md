# PokeBuddy
We want to make some sort of paint app that uses the graphic functions from the TFT_eSPI library in hope that we make some animatios for our project in a more compact format.
## **To do list:**
- [X] Extract the main functions we're gonna use from the header file
- [ ] Find a way to take the function result and display it:
  ### From what I saw, we only need to modify 2 functions to make this work?, respectively:
- [ ] setWindow() -> this function should just throw the x, y and the heigth and width
- [ ] pushBlock() -> this function should just throw what color the rectangle from setwindows should have
